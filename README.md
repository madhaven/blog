# mad_blog

_The difference between a scientist and a layman is that the scientist writes down everything._  
The mad_blog is my attempt to record and log and share my journey in technology with the world.  
In each blog, I wish to

* document my growth in technology.  
* convey what I learn.
* explore possibilities for better systems.
* keep it simple.

## Blogs

* [Hello World][1] - my advent into Computer Science
